## Prop spawns

Let's start off by importing and cleaning our prop statistics. I'll filter props that have 0 spawns, as they should be irrelevant to the rest of our analysis.

```{r Load and clean data}
props <- read.csv(file = 'data/propstatistics.csv') %>%
  filter(spawns != 0)
```

Now let's check out the data set:

```{r Show prop stats dataframe}
props
```
